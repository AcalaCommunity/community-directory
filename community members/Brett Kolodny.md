# Brett Kolodny

## City and Country

New York, New York, USA

## Background

I graduated from SUNY Buffalo with a degree in Computer Science, and am now a Software Engineer at Acala!

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

Acala not only makes DeFi easy the custom EVM implementation also completely changes what's possible with DeFi dapps using the on chain scheduler and "bring your own gas"!

## Fun facts and details about yourself

In my free time I like to create 3d art with Blender! I'm hoping to someday bridge these two parts of my life and mint some NFTs of my art.

You can also find me as `Bread#0837` on Discord!
