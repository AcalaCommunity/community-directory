# Brett Kolodny

Hi! I'm Brett Kolodny, I recently graduated from SUNY Buffalo with a degree in Computer Science and am now a Software Engineer at Acala!

I live in NYC, and can find me on Discord at `Bread#0837`.

I also make 3d art in my spare time, hoping to branch that out into NFTs in the future!
