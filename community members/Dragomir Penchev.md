# Dragomir Penchev

## City and Country

Varna, Varna, Bulgaria

## Background

I have a Master's degree in Business management. I own a small company for weather data and have 15 years of farming experience. Passionate and dedicated to  crypto since 2016.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

I'm exited about Acala because it will combine what AAVE, Compound, Maker and Lido are offering + much more #defi tools and all that at cost much much lower than ETH.

## Fun facts and details about yourself

I was expected to become a farmer and yield wheat and sunflower but at the end of the day I have become a degen farmer looking for a yeild all over different crypto projects :D
