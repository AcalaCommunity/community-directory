## Background
Hello! I first joined crypto space back in 2017. I am a Full-time Fronend Developer in a security company in Switzerland. I am also one of Bitcoin Addict Thailand's admins since 2017.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
Because of the words, 'DeFi Hub', it is simple but powerful words. Also functionalities that Acala is going to provide made me want to be part of the community.

## Fun facts and details about yourself
I told myself back then that 'That's it, I'm not going to learn any new language, only Thai (Native) and English will be enough for the rest of my life'. Guess what !!! now I am learning German and only Thai and English are not enough anymore.
