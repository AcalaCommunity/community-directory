## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
I've been in crypto for several years, but seriously trading for only about 1 year. Learned a bit about DeFi in general in Aug '21 and invested in 4 projects, including Karura and the more I learn the more I like it.  Currently enrolled in the Decentralized Finance MOOC @ Berkeley https://defi-learning.org and hoping to study Rust and Substrate (development languages) as well.
