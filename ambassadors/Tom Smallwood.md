Hello!. I am an iOS developer from Tucson, AZ. I have worked on a lot mainstream apps for companies like Disney, Marvel, Subway, Caesars Las Vegas, Whole Foods, and more.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

I initially feel in love with Ethereum and saw what decentralized applications (dapps) can do. With the creation of Kusama and Polkadot I see dapps going to another level with the scalability of these two platforms. I see Acala and Karura being the best projects on these two platforms and will really show what a complete defi application can do. I cannot wait to see what is built and developed over the next few years and very excited to be a part of it.

## Fun facts and details about yourself

I love sports, a bit obsessed. I have a season tickets for Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals, and University of Arizona Basketball (Bear Down).
