## City and Country

## Background

I graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in Land Economy, and am a Tech aficionado and Investor. Fell down the crypto rabbit hole not too long ago and have been enjoying it here ever since.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

As an investment professional, I can tell you just how broken the legacy financial system is and I'm so relieved that someone has finally found a remedy to this malady. Acala and Karura are powerful platforms that combine the potential of DeFi with the potency of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Glad to be part of history in the making and keen to contribute.
