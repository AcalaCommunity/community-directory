## City and Country
Sofia, Bulgaria

## Background
Before I started doing crypto I worked in b2b-sales - computers, and hardware. I have also some trading experience in the forex markets. I have been working in the crypto industry for three years. I am trying to support growth of the industry by writing articles, translations and building local crypto communities.
I am currently regional leader in the Covalent Alchemist program for the Bulgarian community and help with international development.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

At the moment the most used platform to build crypto apps is Ethereum, but high gas fees and lack of interoperability between different L2 solutions is a major obstacle to mass adoption of cryptocurrency.
I think Acala would be a solution to both problems providing Acala Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) combined with lower gas fees and use of Polkadot underlying security infrastructure.

## Fun facts and details about yourself
