# Your Name
Daniel Olano

## City and Country
From Colombia, based in Berlin, Germany.

## Background
A builder(sometimes destroyer) at hearth messing around with technology and computers from an early age, dropped out of studying telecommunications engineering while understanding how the Internet does its wonders, then started an entrepreneurial career as a developer trying to make some social impact.  
After some failed attempts at changing the world moved to Germany to work in the mobility industry, learned cool tricks as a developer specialized in geo-related topics and got quite interested in self-driving car technology while working in the industry.  
Now as the Head of Blockchain at Valiu, fully committed to building the *Valiu Liquidity Network*, a **composable with Acala** chain that bridges the fiat world to the Polkadot ecosystem, giving access to everyone in Latin America(and the world) to strong, transparent, stable money.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
Acala sits at the center of a DeFi revolution enabled by Polkadot's interoperability between chains that will change how money moves around the world. Being part of this change and helping to make it a reality is a pretty exciting endeavor.

## Fun facts and details about yourself
Code is not the only fun way to build things, I enjoy manual crafts, puzles, hardware, design(or at least a minimum sense of esthetics) and if all the skills can be put together in a single open source project even better! Worth noting that my formidable procrastination skills usually get in the way of many fun projects.
