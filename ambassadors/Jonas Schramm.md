## Background

// Personal Background:
I grew up in a small town in Germany and skipped 3 grades,
so I finished High School pretty early, after that I "jobbed" in multiple
different Restaurants and Hotels as a Waiter and Chef, because I really
didn't want to go to a College.

I realized pretty quick that I like "serving" people, not only
with food and drinks, it was more about making people happy and give them
a great experience. So I followed that path and went to two different Trade Schools
for "Hotel & Restaurant Management" but it started pretty early that I got
interested in the Business Site of it, like preparing Seminars, Pitch to
People or just give Companies a good time during their Seminars.
After my "Education", I started working Full-Time in multiple Business-Hotels,
and won a bunch of local and nationwide Competitions in this field, so I started
connecting to a lot of big companies like T-Mobile, Coca-Cola, Hilton, Volkswagen,
Mercedes, etc., I was still pretty young, just turned 21 at that time.

I was looking for a real challenge and wanted more and more, because for the standard
of Germany my family was "poor" so I was very focused on making money at that time,
I worked at least 14H a day with basically no day off for years.
At some point a Job-Hunter recruited me for a "Teamleader"-Postion in a big
Theme-Park in Germany for the "Business to Pleasure"-Department, (if you want to
check it out: https://www.phantasialand.de/en/business-to-pleasure/),
I did that job for around 5 years, at the end I was the Assistant-Director
of that department and had around 250 people under me.

During that time, I learned A LOT about company structures and the business Site
of things, but at some point I realized that all this money, means nothing if
you don't use it to support your community or the less fortunate in the world,
so I started "volunteering" in local Churches, Homeless-Shelters, Rehab-Clinics, etc.

At some point I found a big "Volunteer-Organization" that has Sites all over the world,
So I quit my very good job with a bunch of awards, certifications and money,
broke up with my girlfriend at that time, left everything behind
and started travelling the world and met a lot of great people all over the world.

So I became a Board-Member (Head of PR/Marketing) of that Organization 3 years ago,
during this time I learned A LOT about internal structures that you need with
an international Organization like that.

// Crypto Background:
My first exposure to crypto was around 11 years ago with Bitcoin, messing around in the "Darknet"
I kinda lost my focus on it due my "busy life", at some point I realized that crypto is really "getting big",
around 2015 or 16. So I came back and invested a good amount of my income in different projects, learned
the beauty of Trading, TA, Research, Blockchain Basics, Community Structures and of course had a bunch of lessions
with scams: "BITCOOOOOOOOOONNNECT", I always was connected to a bunch of people in the space learned the values
that crypto can give to world, especially on my 3 year journey around the world I realized that so many people cannot
access money, or not even a bank-account, so I think that's one of my favorite things about crypto, it can literally
change somebodies life in a heartbeat. So I opened up my own Patreon/Discord Community with another early Adopter, where
we teach people do be successful in this market, risk/reward ratios, TA and everything you might need. Myself, I don't
trade that much myself anymore, but Crypto is my Main-Source of Income, but I'm more invested in multiple DeFi Projects now,
because with my Funds that's just the smarter way to do it. All my Income from my Patreon get's donated to different
Charities around the world, or we help local community projects from community members. 

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
Due to this task I came along the Parachain Crowdloans and teached my Community in how to participate and what it means
to the space, and that's how I found Acala/Karura and I noticed VERY QUICK that this project is something very special,
it just combines so many things into one awesome project and this is already a big win for the space, in addition I rarely
saw so much passion from a "Team-Perspective" and I love the "Community-Involvement" and due to my nature of teaching people, helping people and my little "work-mania", I just needed to apply for this Ambassadorship and really hope I can give value
to Acala and do my part to make it a little better everyday!


## Fun facts and details about yourself
I was in the Top 10 of Doge-Holders for multiple years
It took Kucoin 5 Days to pay out all my KAR Tokens that I bought because their Treasury was not big enough. LOL!
I lost a Ledger with 250 BTC on it. R.I.P
I brought 200+ people to Karura already and babysit at least 50+ in their first Babysteps in Karura.
