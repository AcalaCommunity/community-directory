# Gilbert Bassey

Lagos, Nigeria

I am a writer and filmmaker with a passion for decentralization. I mostly write articles for blockchain projects I believe in.

I am excited about DeFi because it is the perfect combatant against the perils of centralization. I'm excited for Acala and Kaura because they take DeFi to the next level--multi-chain.

I'm a creature habit: if I'm not sleeping by 10PM, then something is very wrong...or right...lol.
I've also been labeled a robot by at least 4 different people.
I love making music.
