## Background
Hello! I'm the Community & Growth Manager at Acala and excited to work directly with the ambassadors. You can find me on Discord as: Robin | Acala#0621. As an advocate for decentralized technologies and open finance, I've worked with a variety of projects in the blockchain space, including wallet providers, oracle services, DeFi protocols, and DAOs. Prior to blockchain tech, I developed growth strategies for Fender Music, American Public Media, FiveThirtyEight, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation – with whom I led workshops on responsible data, Creative Commons, and Net Neutrality.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

I’ve always had a curiosity for technology and its power to inform change. I believe that through innovative networks like Acala and Karura, we’re granted an opportunity to build collaborative, empowered, and equitable communities. I'm so excited to onboard more folks to DeFi!

## Fun facts and details about yourself

I love collecting vinyl (prince, post-punk) and I play guitar. When I'm not camping in national parks, I'm working through my film queue.
