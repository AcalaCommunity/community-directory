## Background

I am a blockchain enthusiast who first discovered Bitcoin in 2011, when I found out that I could play poker with it. I fell in love with the technology right away, and I've been following it to some extent ever since. I used to be a Steem witness (block producer).

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

DeFi can remove the barriers that have shut people out of the traditional financial system. Acala and Karura make DeFi even more accessible with micro gas fees and a unified portal for the full range of borrowing, stablecoins, decentralized exchange and innovative features like liquid staking.

## Fun facts and details about yourself

I've lived in city parks and anarchist squats as an activist. I spent a summer in Colorado sleeping in a tent in an apple orchard and volunteering on oranic farms. I love live music and festivals.
