## Background
I've been a crypto enthusiast since 2017 and currently live and work in the frosty Canadian north. I have an under graduate degree in political science and completed my master's degree in public administration in 2015. I moved my wife and son from a life of relative ease in southern Canada to the north to pursue work in the precious metals and mining sector. Currently I work as a policy analyst, but I've held various positions throughout my career. I've also recently started taking some courses in FinTech through Hong Kong University.
## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
After a bumpy start to my crypto experience in 2018 I took a much more analytical approach to crypto investing, outlining several problems and concerns that any new projects would have to address in order to earn my investment dollars. In early 2021 I came across Polkadot, arguably far later than I would have liked, and was instantly excited about Dr. Woods' vision for the network.

As I began to research and read about the benefits of Polkadot I became very interested in the crowd loan model. Having done quite a bit of research on DeFi and its potential to free individuals from the established legacy banking model and enable people to be their own bank. So naturally, when it was time to choose a project to support during the first round of crowd loans I backed Acala because the vision espoused by its creators resonated with me.

Since joining the Acala ambassador team I've met some great people and had some excellent discussions about the future of Acala. It is clear to me that this project is supported and run by some exceptionally bright individuals and I'm honoured to be part of it. I'm excited for the launch of the Acala DEX and the possibility of a community DAO, and I think Bette's vision for the future direction of Acala with FinTech integrations is absolutely where the project should be headed.
## Fun facts and details about yourself
I'm an avid winter sports enthusiast and you will find me out riding my bike in all kinds of weather, the coldest ride I've completed to date was at about -46C/-51F with the windchill it was closer to -66C/-87F. In the summer months I spend most of my free time playing disc golf and travelling. I've lived, worked and recreated in nearly every country in Europe and can't wait to return.
