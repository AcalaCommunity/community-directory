## Background
Hello Acala! I've recently joined Acala community as an ambassador and I am very excited about the upcoming opportunities and challenges. You can always find me on Discord: Orig2g#7483. I've been interested in Crypto space since 2018 as an investor, but recently I've also started studying Solidity to be able to impact the industry. Meanwhile I am working as an RPA developer and architect on Italian market, aiming on automation of the routine pprocesses for the biggest  utility companies.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi

The fact is that the currently perople have a very limited knowledge and access to the  modern financial tools. Average person would surely get lost in staking, collateration and all other terms used in almost every sinle DeFi app. How to change it? Give people testnet app, create an amazing UI and do the educational series in different languages on different topics. Make everyone feel the difference and understand how can they apply the obtained knowledge tomorrow to make their life better. That is why I am here, and that is what I am aiming to achieve!

## Fun facts and details about yourself

I love endurance events, and I used to unconscionusly swap names of some of my friends.
