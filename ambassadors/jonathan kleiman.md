# Jonathan Kleiman

## Toronto, Canada

## Lawyer, entrepreneur, crypto obsessive 

## I fancy myself an amateur futurist. Polkadot/Kasuma are the future of blockchain, blockchain is the future of freedom, defi is the future of financial freedom, and Acala is the future of defi

## I am 36, a father of two amazing little girls, a self-employed business lawyer, a polkadot ambassador candidate, and a potential polkadot registrar (support proposal #13!). I did my undergrad in Philosophy and Poli-Sci at McGill (and got an A in Java as an elective!), and Queen's University for law. I am very humble, and I scored in the 99th percentile on the LSAT's 👍🏻
