## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
I'm excited about Acala because is combines all features of Compound, AAVE, MAKER, LIDO and at the same time is its own blockchain providing experience similar to ETH but at much lower gas costs
## Fun facts and details about yourself
I was expected to become a full time farmers taking care for the yield from wheat and corn but instead I'have become a humber crypto farmer (I't not much but it's an honest work) :D
