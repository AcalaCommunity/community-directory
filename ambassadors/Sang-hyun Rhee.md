# Your Name
Sang-hyun, Rhee (or simply called, RHEE)

## City and Country
Seoul, South Korea

## Background
I was a Game IP Manager back in 2016 Feb until 2018 Jan,
I transformed my carreer into crypto-space from 2018 Feb (as an EOS Wallet Product Manager, designing DPOS UX/UI),
then moved forward to a Korean Crypto-VC while pitching the EOS wallet mention above and started my career as Blockchain Product Analyst.
Now I am ambassador of Acala, Astar, HydraDX, which I believe will be the strongest tech-based parachains dealing with Infra-structure, Defi, Stablecoins and Crosschain Bridges.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
Acala is the first-ever crosschain De-Fi project with highest understanding of all features of Polkadot/Kusama,
So I believe Acala will swallow most of the liquidity in-out-out across different blockchains.
Also I am interested in running collator node for Acala and contribute bug bounties to make Acala Ecosystem sustainable and stay healthy.
Last but not least, I Will try my best to do best PR Movements within our Korean Community and get them workaround with our upcoming products.
