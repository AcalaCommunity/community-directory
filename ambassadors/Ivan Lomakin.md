## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
I'm very excited about the Acala project. I've been watching the Polcadot project since 2018. And the start of Acala network was great. The idea of decentralized finance is fantastic. With the advent of cryptocurrencies, everything went towards Defi. I believe in the future with Defi and crypto.
