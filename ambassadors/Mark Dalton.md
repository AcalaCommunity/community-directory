# Mark Dalton

## City and Country
Buffalo, MN  USA by way of Minnesota, New Mexico, New Jersey
   And looking for a new country.

## Background
  First bought bitcoin in 2012, 2016-2018, and March 2020.
  More originally to 'support the cause'. On discord: Mark Dalton#9347
  And email: markwdalton@gmail.com.  Background is in genetics/cell biology/Virology education/research.
  Then turned computational biology 1989-1993, and HPC/Supercomputing 1991 - present.  Linux since 1995.
  Parallel programming, Systems engineer, data security, automation.
  Mostly worked for Cray Research/Cray Inc, and now LambdaLabs.com [AI/ML/DL computing solutions].
  I enjoy teaching people blockchain/cryptocurrency, linux, robotics, genetic/cell biology, computing, web development and sharing in music/guitar.
  I have been following many of the DeFi projects, I like the concept of cross chain/interoperability.  I would like to see eventually
  various wallets/decentralized exchanges/etc that can handle other chains, with better management for the end user.
     * Purchase date, token, total number, average purchase price, price, %gain/loss
        lot 1: Purchase date, token, number of coins, purchase price, price, %gain/loss
        lot 2: Purchase date, token, number of coins, purchase price, price, %gain/loss
           ...
        lot N: Purchase date, token, number of coins, purchase price, price, %gain/loss
     * Donation platform and micro-loan platform - like kiva.org

  In crypto I am in the Ivan On Tech academy [more ethereum], ran a self hosted substrate node for learning Substrate at home.
  So working on learning more on this.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
  I love the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystems basic design and interoperability goals [versus the eth-killer attitude].  I want to contribute and help Karura/Acala succeed where I can.   I want everyone to have access to banking, investments, regardless of where they live in the world or their supposed 'status'.

## Fun facts and details about yourself
  I love to travel, live in other cultures, play guitar, bansuri flute, keyboard and hand drums.  I love to camp, hike, explore.  Or just sit down and talk about anything acedemic, just thinking through problems with someone, learning, gaining insights.  I like to do hobbies and teach in areas of: Robotics, Linux, Crypto, AI/ML/DL, music.
