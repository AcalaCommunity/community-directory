# Grace Watahara

## Osaka Japan

## I have been in blockchain since 2017, and currently am an asset manager by day, and blockchain project ambassador by night.

## I'm so excited to be part of this team because I know the team keeps their words and have so much to offer to the blockchain community. I believe it will break so many of the problems in the finance sphere.

## I love learning about new technologies and languages. I love traveling and eating so I can't wait till COVID is over and we can travel to promote this project to all over the world :) Please feel free to contact me. I love connecting with fellow blockchain enthusiasts!
