## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
It's very interesting for "The DeFi Hub of Polkadot" because it's a huge concept/vision/mission and also very challenge. Moreover, Ethereum-compatible platform for financial applications to use smart contracts or built-in protocols with out-of-the-box cross-chain capabilities and robust security is a key success concept.
