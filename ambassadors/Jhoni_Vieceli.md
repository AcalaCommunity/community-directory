Jhoni Vieceli

## City and Country
Porto - Portugal

## Background
I have a degree from the University of Porto in Information Science and I am currently doing a master's degree in Information Science as well. At the same time, I am studying the Industry Connect's Substrate Academy course, so that I can participate more actively in the development of ecosystem projects.
I am also involved in the Polkadot ambassador program in Portugal and recently a member of the Acala ambassador team.

## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
Acala demonstrates an easy way for an ordinary person to manage their financial assets and make gains in an affordable way. Without the need to use traditional trading companies, it encourages people outside the ecosystem to get to know the Defi process in practice with confidence. Thus making it possible to be a bridge so that these people can (as well as new developers), integrate this project, as well as, many other projects in other parachains or relaychains.

## Fun facts and details about yourself
I also like to work with anarchist communities and local horizontal and self-managed community centers, where there is the promotion of local and international art, culture and music. To this end, everyone cooperates so that free food or voluntary donation is offered to everyone who is participating. This food is obtained by recycling food waste from large supermarket chains and is collected and prepared through volunteer work. I would like to be able to use the structure of Polkadot and Acala to be able to offer to discover more of how these communities can be integrated, which depend almost exclusively on themselves for their sustainability.
